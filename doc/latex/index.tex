This program works with a file that must be located inside the directory of the running process. You can use 2 arguments to run {\ttfamily ./testfile -\/rw -\/crc}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Program operation option\+: {\itshape !!!\+One of these options is required to run!!!}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/r} {\itshape Runs a read-\/only program on a file}
\item {\ttfamily -\/w} {\itshape Runs a write-\/only program on a file}
\item {\ttfamily -\/rw} {\itshape Runs a read-\/write program on a file, Splits the program into two threads, one reads, the other writes}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item File hashing option\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/crc} {\itshape An additional option that, if specified, will enable the calculation of the hashing of the file}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you want to change the location of a file, its name or maximum file size, you need to open {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8cpp}{main.\+cpp}}} and change 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{//name file}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::string name\_test\_file = "{}Test.txt"{};}
\DoxyCodeLine{//max size file}
\DoxyCodeLine{uint64\_t max\_size\_file = 5'000'000;}

\end{DoxyCode}
 \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsubsection{Flaws}\label{index_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Can\textquotesingle{}t specify file path via CLI
\item File open handler or exception that will throw an open error (if it cannot be created)
\item When reading a file, the thread loads the processor due to the endless comparison of the file size, a callback is needed that will silently wait for the file to change
\item Interprocessor Synchronization (sockets, pipes, shared memory ...) for writing and reading while using hashing and overwriting a file with a new hash, when a file is written quickly, the read stream reacts instantly and may not wait for the final write of the end of the file, and an overlay occurs in reading
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Building}\label{index_autotoc_md4}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For build, you need cmake(3.\+13 or high), LLVM(GCC/\+CLANG with support c++17).
\item {\ttfamily sudo apt install cmake g++} Install requirement
\item {\ttfamily mkdir build \&\& cd build} Create folder build
\item {\ttfamily cmake ..} run cmake build
\item {\ttfamily make} run build
\item {\ttfamily ctest} run unit tests
\item {\ttfamily ./testfile -\/rw} run program(flag run see above)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Detailed code documentation}\label{index_autotoc_md5}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For detail read code generate doxygen we can run {\ttfamily docs/html/index.\+html}
